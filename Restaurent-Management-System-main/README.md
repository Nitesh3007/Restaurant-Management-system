# :spaghetti:	Restaurent Management System
*A Restaurant Management System using OOPs concepts in C++ Programming Language*

The main aim of the project is to create a Restaurant Management System which manages the restaurant staff, modifies the Menu card items and prices, takes customer order, generates bill and receives bill payment. This program uses the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming like classes, objects, inheritance, friend functions etc. in C++ programming Language using Codebooks IDE. The program first greets the user with a welcome message and then display a User Menu to either enter as a Customer, Admin or a Staff or exit the program. 

The functionalities of all these User options are as follows -

On entering as Customer, a menu appears in which the user can view the Menu of the restaurant, order food items, view the bill and checkout after paying for the food the full amount of bill.

### :woman_technologist:	Admin:

On entering as an Admin, the program first asks for the Admin User ID and Password. No one except the admin can access this page. It gives 3 attempts to enter the correct details after which the program is terminated. After successful login, a menu appears in which the admin can add user access for staff members, see all the staff user details, remove the user access of a staff, a link to directly go to the staff page and a link to return to the user Menu.

### :woman_cook:	 Staff:

On entering as a Staff, the program first asks for the Staff User ID and Password. Only the staff IDs added in the admin database and the admin can access this page. It also gives 3 attempts to enter the correct details after which the program is terminated. On successful login, a menu appears in which the staff can add new food items in the menu, see the food items in the menu along with their price and update the cost of the existing food items in the Food Menu.
